Hi, i am a portuguese programmer. Currently i am taking a computer science degree at ESTGOH.

I pretty much have coded for everything, android, ios, windows, linux, webdev, you name it, but the most fullfilling field and that i truly enjoy working is Android.

When i am not coding (which is rare) i like to watch animes, youtube or just listen to music. Btw, this is my last heard song:

These are my best projects:

[SimpleMP](https://github.com/lighttigerXIV/SimpleMP-Compose) - A simple music player with Material You in mind.

[Whiskers Launcher](https://github.com/lighttigerXIV/whiskers-launcher) - A keyboard app launcher for Linux and Windows and that supports extensions. 

[Catppuccinifier](https://github.com/lighttigerXIV/catppuccinifier) - A gui/cli app to apply catppuccin luts to images.
